## 📚 Overview

This project focuses on detecting lung cancer using two different approaches:

1. **Multi-Class Image Classification**:  
   Classifying histopathological lung tissue images into three categories:
   - Adenocarcinoma
   - Benign
   - Squamous Cell Carcinoma

2. **Binary Classification from Survey Data**:  
   Predicting whether a patient has lung cancer (Yes/No) based on demographic and symptom data.

Both models are built using deep learning techniques with TensorFlow/Keras and classical preprocessing with scikit-learn.
